If you find any bug or any problem feel free to ask.

The usage is as shown in the `main.py` file.
Care on how you use parenthesis because all the logic is based on them.
__*NOTE*__ that _every_ operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) has the _same importance_, so the expression, `5*10-3`, is not the same as, `-3+5*10`.
The reason is because the operations are performed _left-to-right_.
If you want to use the known OOO (Order Of Operations), force the order by using the brackets.
An example: the expression above becomes `(5*10)-3`, in this case if you move the `-3` in front, the operations inside the brackets will have the priority.

Enjoy!
